        <h1>THE MOMENTS</h1>
        <p>Times comes, the small hope you've been having fails to keep you moving</p>
        <p>but you still keep going, because you know that the end is near</p>
        <p>and you know that the death won't find you the way you are now</p>
        <p>but if you won't keep the strong faith you had from the start,<br>the overthinking fucking moments will make you never see the end</p>
        <p>always just be you and keep your real for yourself not the crowd</p>
